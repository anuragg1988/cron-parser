    - Integration tests are written in Junit framework as well and can be found in src.test.java.integration.com.company . And they can be run using "mvn test'
- How to only Run locally:-
    - Install [java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html) in your machine (preferably jdb 1.8)
    - Download the CronParser-1.0.0.jar file locally
    - Execute the jar file with your input command of cron expression like
        - java -jar target/CronParser-1.0.0.jar "5 6 8 1 6"
        - It will show the output on the console
- How to Debug/Update locally:-
    - Install [java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html) in your machine (preferably jdb 1.8)
    - Open project path in terminal
    - Build and compile the project using "mvn clean install" . Note that this would also run local test classes
    - It will create the executable jar in path target/CronParser-1.0.0.jar
    - Execute the jar file with your input command of cron expression like
        - java -jar target/CronParser-1.0.0.jar "5 6 8 1 6"
